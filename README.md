# Cyberlabs_machine_learning
The following repository contains the simplified code for 5 machine learning algorithms: linear regression, polynomial regression, logistic regression, k nearest neighbors and n neural networks using only the numpy, pandas and matplotlib libraries of python.

Machine Learning
Machine learning enables computer systems to learn and improve automatically 
based on experience without being explicitly programmed. It involves the 
development of algorithms and statistical models that allow computer systems to 
identify patterns in data and make predictions or decisions based on that data.
There are mainly two types of machine learning algorithms: Supervised and 
Unsupervised machine learning. All the algorithms that I have solved in this 
project are a part of Supervised machine learning. In supervised learning, we give 
datasets of input x and output y on test dataset x.

1. Multiple Linear Regression
r2 score = 0.8447
runtime = 0 seconds
final cost = 4769.67

2. Polynomial Regression
r2 score for 5th degree = 0.995
r2 score for 3rd degree = 0.889

3. Logistic Regression
accuracy = 89.96%
runtime less than 1.5 min

4. KNN
accuracy = 84.8%

5. Neural Network
  Single Layer Neural Network accuracy = 81.55%
  N Layer Neural Network accuracy = 75.73%
